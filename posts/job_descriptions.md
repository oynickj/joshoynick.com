I like reading job descriptions for companies to get a sense of their culture, tools they use, and ways they help team members onboard. If you'd like to share anything you find interesting or inspiring with me, reach me at oynickj@gmail.com

While this isn't the optimal UI, for now I've copied the JD's below in case the postings go away.

ðŸ›£ What's the hiring process like?
- We canâ€™t wait to read your resume and (hopefully personality-filled) cover letter! Let us know what excites you about business operations, and help us get to know you better!
- If we think we might be a good fit for you, weâ€™ll set up a 30 minute phone chat with our COO, Pat! Heâ€™ll tell you more about the role, and get a chance to hear about your experiences.
- Next will be a second 30 minute phone interview with our Head of Marketing, Sarah, where weâ€™ll dive a bit more into your background.
- Then weâ€™ll invite you to an "onsite" interview conducted over Zoom! These usually take 3.5 to 5 hours including an hour break in between. We are able to be flexible with the schedule and split it up over two days if that works best for you! We start with a 15-minute get-to-know-you with the strat team so you can meet the people youâ€™ll be working with, and then have you talk with people one-on-one later on.
- Weâ€™ll let you know how things went within a week! If it still seems like a good fit all around, weâ€™ll extend you an offer! If not, we will update you to let you know so you arenâ€™t left hanging.
