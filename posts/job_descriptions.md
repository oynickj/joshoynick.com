I like reading job descriptions for companies to get a sense of their culture, tools they use, and ways they help team members onboard. If you'd like to share anything you find interesting or inspiring with me, reach me at oynickj@gmail.com

While this isn't the optimal UI, for now I've copied the JD's below in case the postings go away.
