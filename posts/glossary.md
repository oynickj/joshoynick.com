When I learn a new concept/term, add a basic definition and links here:

- Turing Complete: Alan Turing envisioned a machine that could take a program of any complexity and run it (given enough tape and enough time). A calculator isn't Turing Complete - it can only do pre-defined operations. Most programming languages, assuming infinite memory and time, are Turing Complete. Why do we care? I'm not sure.
